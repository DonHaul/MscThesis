## RGB-D Camera Network Calibration for 3D Model Reconstruction

**Keywords:** Camera networks, 3D reconstruction, RGB-D data, Multi Cloud Registration

### Objectives:
* Obtain the transformations and Rotations 
* Acquisition of More Complete Models

### Description:
This Msc Thesis has 2 main repositories:
 - [MultiCamCalAruco](https://github.com/DonHaul/MultiCamCalAruco/tree/master):
In this repo, a method was developed, that does two things:
	1. Obtain the positions and rotations of Aruco markers, in a calibration  object.
	2. Use that calibration object, to find calibrate a multi-camera RGB network
	More information  about it and instructions about its installation and use can be found on the repo.
  - [Rvidere](https://github.com/DonHaul/Rvidere)
  This repository is responsible for launching a multi camera RGB-D network that can be found in LRM in IST.


On top of these, the present repository contains matlab code developed by R. Toldo et. al. ([Link](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228959196)), to register multiple point clouds simultaneously.
